# Welcome!

Currently, I am working as a postdoctoral fellow at the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Waterloo]("https://uwaterloo.ca/civil-environmental-engineering/"). 

Please visit the Hydrology group at the University of Waterloo [here]("https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/btolson/people-0")

I previously worked as a Project Researcher in [Global Hydrodynamics Lab]("https://global-hydrodynamics.github.io/") in [Institute of Industrial Science]("https://www.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/"), [The University of Tokyo]("https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/") from Oct 2019 to Aug 2023. In the Global Hydrodynamics Lab, we are working on freshwater dynamics on a global scale using modeling, remote sensing, and model data integration.

Please visit Global Hydrodynamics Lab [here]("https://global-hydrodynamics.github.io/").


## Research Interests
My primary research interests are hydrological modeling and integrating remote sensing data into models. Currently, I am working on observing Canadian lakes using the SWOT satellite. Previously, I have been working on data assimilation into hydrodynamic modeling using satellite altimetry data. I am also involved in developing [CaMa-Flood]("https://github.com/global-hydrodynamics/CaMa-Flood_v4") hydrodynamic model for a better representation of global fresh water.

## Recent Updates
### 8 Jan, 2024
A data description paper was published in Earth System Science Data, [AltiMaP: altimetry mapping procedure for hydrography data](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-16-75-2024). In this study, we developed an automated method to allocate satellite altimetry data on rivers to global hydrodynamic models.

### 5 July, 2023
A co-authored data description paper was published in Earth System Science Data, [Res-CN (Reservoir dataset in China): hydrometeorological time series and landscape attributes across 3254 Chinese reservoirs
](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-2781-2023). In this study, we develop the first database consisting of reservoir-catchment characteristics for 3254 Chinese reservoirs.

### 7 Feb, 2023
A co-authored letter was published in Environmental Research Letters, [Increased floodplain inundation in the Amazon since 1980](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/acb9a7), led by [Ayan Santos Fleischmann](https://www.ufrgs.br/lsh/team/phd-students/ayan-santos-fleischmann/).
